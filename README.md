# musical_systems
hey this is the raw code and midi files that I used to create my musical systems analysis post. 
Basically, the single song folder contains everything you need to look at just one song, the webscrapper folder allows you to get masses of data, and the final folder allows you to analyze it en masse. It generates files too big to be hoseted on GitHub (~100Meg), so run the scripts that generate the numpy files before you analyze the data.
